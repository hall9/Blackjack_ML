# ALICE ML Blackjack Project

## Mission
Create BlackJack using ALICE ML.

## Requirements:
The program should represent cards as values of specific types and the deck as a list of those cards.
The computer should be able to "shuffle" and deal "random" cards to the players.
Yes... this is a bit "non-functional" but not that hard either.
The player should be able to indicate their desired action on a given turn (Hit or Stay)
The computer opponent should respond and play appropriately (hit on anything lower than 17).
(The computer AI does not necessarily need be "good", it should just play legally).
The game should continue though at least one complete "hand" of the game.
 
## Blackjack RULES
* 21 = BlackJack
* >21 Bust
* Highest hand count wins if not blackjack or higher

1. Player Goes first.
2. Player can Hit or Stay on the hand.
 ..* You shouldn't worry about "splits" and "double downs"...
3. Dealer next, hits on 16 or below
 
**Also note:** Feel free to use ML's "Basis Functions" (the standard library) where appropriate.**DO NOT USE Array functions or References**. This is simply because the goal of this project is to teach "Functional Programming". ML, while primarily a functional language, it is not technically a "pure functional language", as it offers both Functional and Imperative constructs. Arrays and References are examples of those imperative constructs. 
 
RFI: Midnight, April 18th
No further project specification questions will answered after this time.
Deliverable: Start of class, April 23rdth.
All Source code must be submitted to Blackboard.

ML Source file(s) for your solution
Should be reasonably well commented and free of Syntax errors.
Brief description or any relevant notes for testing your program.
NOTE: The program should run when "stated"... the user should not need to manually invoke a function to get it going.
